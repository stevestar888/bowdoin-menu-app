# bowdoin-menu-app
We built a shell for https://www.bowdoin.edu/dining/menus/index.html

Built this for the Texas A&M hackathon

Group: Josh, Tugi, Steven

## Inspiration
With our shared passion for our college's dining hall food, we decided to create a website that displays the menu in a fun way. With O(n!) options available, we wanted to simplify this process for students and created a fun "Make a Meal" feature that will generate a random meal. We canâ€™t wait to use it for ourselves and friends for when we're together on-campus! 

## What it does
- Displays the daily menu for Breakfast/Lunch/Dinner at a specific dining hall
- If desired, suggests a meal (which includes one item from each category for the current mealtime)
-provide serotonin with a picture of Patrick Dempsey

## How we built it
- together
-We called the Bowdoin Menu API and stored each of the items in a dictionary that will be used to create a random meal. We used Java, HTML, CSS for a shell website of the bowdoin dining menu. 

## Challenges we ran into
- figuring out how to access the dining hall menu data
- parsing items from data
- front-end bugs

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- figuring out how to access the dining hall menu data
- finishing on time

## What we learned
- UI/UX design can be tough!


## What's next for Dining Hall Meal Maker
- increasing functionality + sprucing up the design
- Including the calories and nutrient information for each item
